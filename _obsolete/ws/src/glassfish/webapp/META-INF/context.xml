		There seems to be a bug in Glassfish v3 which surfaces when a
		so-called skinny war is deployed inside an ear. A skinny war is a war
		that places some or all of its dependencies not in WEB-INF/lib but
		rather inside the enclosing ear. The latter dependencies - those not
		found in WEB-INF/lib have to be referenced via appropriate Class-Path
		entries in that war's MANIFEST.MF.
		
		Now in our situation we have a deployment structure as follows:
		
		ear
			lib/dep1.jar
			lib/dep2.jar
			ejb1-module.jar
			this-module.war
			
		and therefore in this war's MANIFEST.MF:
		
		Class-Path: lib/dep1.jar lib/dep2.jar
		
		When scanning the jars registered in MANIFEST.MF for tag libraries, 
		Glassfish/Tomcat looks not for lib/dep1.jar inside the enclosing ear, but
		rather for lib/lib/dep1.jar. This leads to nasty warnings upon startup. 
		Since we don't use tag libraries anyway, we simply disable tld scanning.
		
		EXCEPT THAT IT DOESN'T WORK!
