
								Building CamelPE
								================

Modify your user-level settings.xml
===================================

Copy the

	<profiles>
	...
	</profiles>

section from

	settings-sample.xml

into your user-level settings.xml, usually found in

	~/.m2/settings.xml.
	
This section declares the repositories and plugin repositories needed to
successfully build CamelPE. For an explanation for why it is usually (though
not always) a bad idea to put repository declarations into the pom.xml itself
see

	http://www.sonatype.com/people/2009/02/why-putting-repositories-in-your-poms-is-a-bad-idea/
	
Building
========

Add

	-Pnet.camelpe.profile
	
to every maven invocation, e.g.

	mvn -Pnet.camelpe.profile clean install
	
and you are done.
